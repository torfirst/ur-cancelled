# Ur Cancelled App

## Description

Our motivation in the project was to create an interactive scheduling/canceling website designed to get two users and make it so they could schedule an event and cancel it if need be, where one user can cancel it and it doesn't eliminate the event but when both users cancel it eliminates the event, this is alo what we wanted to com e out of this app. Our app solves the problems of scheduling an event that you didn't really want to attend where you can cancel and the other user cancels it, it eliminates the event. Through this project our team learn how to professionally organize files, use my sql, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, GET and POST routes, using one new library package (confetti button), and connecting it all wit java script.
